        <h2>Exit Ticket Summary</h2>
        <p>"Great! Let’s break down the key insights from your students’ feedback to understand their perspective on your last class about the elements of design. Here's what the data tells us so far:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>✅ Understanding of the Topic:</strong> Most responses fall into “Very well” or “Mostly understood.” Teaching was effective overall. A quick recap is recommended for a few outliers.</li>
            <li><strong>🎯 Confidence in Design Process:</strong> Students felt confident about planning layout, brainstorming ideas, and presenting work. Consider focusing on weaker areas like idea development or iteration.</li>
            <li><strong>🧑🤝🧑 Group vs Individual Work Preferences:</strong> Most prefer a balance of both, with some leaning toward group work. Mixing tasks is advisable.</li>
            <li><strong>🛠️ Suggestions for Improvement:</strong> One student requested help with brainstorming themes. A short segment on idea generation is suggested.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Screenshots or visuals summarizing student data can be added here for more context.</p>
